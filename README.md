 Data Logging Project as part of ECE 387
  
 Created by Cade Doebele and Mason Parrish
 
 Goal: To sample an arbitrary waveform between 1Hz and 100KHz, approximately 
 Square, sinusoidal, triangular, sawtooth, or DC in shape, and approximately
 0.5V to 5V in amplitude. Makes use of MCP3002 ADC and DE2-115 for sampling, 
 then uses an EEPROM chip for persistent storage.

 Digi-key Part Numbers:
 
 EEPROM IC chip (Digi-Key Part # 24LC256-I/P-ND)
 
 Analog to Digital converter IC chip (Digi-Key Part # MCP3002-I/P-ND)
